          Dune is a 1965 epic science fiction novel by American author Frank
          Herbert, originally published as two separate serials in Analog
          magazine. It tied with Roger Zelazny's This Immortal for the Hugo
          Award in 1966 and it won the inaugural Nebula Award for Best Novel. It
          is the first installment of the <strong>Dune Chronicles</strong>. It
          is one of the world's best-selling science fiction novels.
        </p>

          Dune is set in the distant future in a feudal interstellar society in
          which various noble houses control planetary fiefs. It tells the story
          of young <strong>Paul Atreides</strong>, whose family accepts the
          stewardship of the planet Arrakis. While the planet is an inhospitable
          and sparsely populated desert wasteland it is the only source of
          melange, or "spice", a drug that extends life and enhances mental
          abilities. Melange is also necessary for space navigation, which
          requires a kind of multidimensional awareness and foresight that only
          the drug provides. As melange can only be produced on Arrakis, control
          of the planet is a coveted and dangerous undertaking. The story
          explores the multilayered interactions of politics, religion, ecology,
          technology, and human emotion, as the factions of the empire confront
          each other in a struggle for the control of Arrakis and its spice.
        </p>
        <p>Herbert wrote <strong>five sequels:</strong></p>

          <li>Dune Messiah</li>
          <li>Children of Dune</li>

            Adaptations of the novel to cinema have been notoriously difficult
            and complicated. In the 1970s, cult filmmaker Alejandro Jodorowsky
            attempted to make a film based on the novel. After three years of
            development, the project was canceled due to a constantly growing
            budget. In 1984, a film adaptation directed by David Lynch was
            released to mostly negative responses from critics and failure at
            the box office, although it later developed a cult following. The
            book was also adapted into the 2000 Sci-Fi Channel miniseries Frank
            Herbert's Dune and its 2003 sequel Frank Herbert's Children of Dune
            (the latter of which combines the events of Dune Messiah and
            Children of Dune).
          </p>
          <p>
            A second film adaptation directed by
            <strong>Denis Villeneuve</strong> was released on October 21, 2021,
            to positive reviews. It grossed $401 million worldwide and went on
            to be nominated for ten Academy Awards, winning six. Villeneuve's
            film covers roughly the first half of the original novel; a sequel,
            which will cover the remaining story, will be released in March
            2024.

        <p>
          After his novel <i>The Dragon in the Sea</i> was published in 1957,
          Herbert traveled to Florence, Oregon, at the north end of the Oregon
          Dunes. Here, the United States Department of Agriculture was
          attempting to use poverty grasses to stabilize the sand dunes. Herbert
          claimed in a letter to his literary agent, Lurton Blassingame, that
          the moving dunes could "swallow whole cities, lakes, rivers,
          highways." Herbert's article on the dunes, "They Stopped the Moving
          Sands", was never completed (and only published decades later in
          <i>The Road to Dune</i>), but its research sparked Herbert's interest
          in ecology and deserts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Herbert further drew inspiration from Native American mentors like
          "Indian Henry" (as Herbert referred to the man to his son; likely a
          Henry Martin of the Hoh tribe) and Howard Hansen. Both Martin and
          Hansen grew up on the Quileute reservation near Herbert's hometown.
          According to historian Daniel Immerwahr, Hansen regularly shared his
          writing with Herbert. "White men are eating the earth," Hansen told
          Herbert in 1958, after sharing a piece on the effect of logging on the
          Quileute reservation. "They're gonna turn this whole planet into a
          wasteland, just like North Africa." The world could become a "big
          dune," Herbert responded in agreement.

            Herbert spent the next five years researching, writing, and
            revising. He published a three-part serial Dune World in the monthly
            Analog, from December 1963 to February 1964. The serial was
            accompanied by several illustrations that were not published again.
            After an interval of a year, he published the much slower-paced
            five-part The Prophet of Dune in the Januaryâ€“May 1965 issues. The
            first serial became "Book 1: Dune" in the final published Dune
            novel, and the second serial was divided into "Book Two: Muad'dib"
            and "Book Three: The Prophet". The serialized version was expanded,
            reworked, and submitted to more than twenty publishers, each of whom
            rejected it. The novel, <i>Dune</i>, was finally accepted and
            published in August 1965 by Chilton Books, a printing house better
            known for publishing auto repair manuals.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sterling Lanier, an editor at Chilton, had seen Herbert's manuscript
            and had urged his company to take a risk in publishing the book.
            However, the first printing, priced at $5.95 (equivalent to $55.25
            in 2022), did not sell well and was poorly received by critics as
            being atypical of science fiction at the time. Chilton considered
            the publication of <i>Dune</i> a write-off and Lanier was fired.Over
            the course of time, the book gained critical acclaim, and its
            popularity spread by word-of-mouth to allow Herbert to start working
            full time on developing the sequels to Dune, elements of which were
            already written alongside <i>Dune</i>.
